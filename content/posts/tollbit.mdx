You've probably already seen the headlines about the New York Times suing OpenAI, which has been the scorecard for the more general battle between publishers and AI applications.
But this battle is only heating up. Publishers are just only the first people to care. Anyone who makes a living off of human eyeballs leading to ad revenue will be affected.

### The problem

AI-powered apps like Arc Search and Perpexity that make it so you don't ever have to actually travel to the primary source.
These types of "answer engines" are just the tip of the iceberg.
Rabbit and the Humane AI Pin are both devices that need real-time information in the same way. Are these also going to scrape websites for answers? The value of a company's customer facing website is going to 0.
Why should we have to scroll Twitter in the exact way a random team of engineers decided a few years ago? If my AI Agent can generate the whole page for me, why do I need to go to nytimes.com?

The AI agent is slowly becoming a browser replacement as a new portal to the Internet. But in this future, there is still one detail no one has been able to solve, which is exactly why this content creator vs. AI company battle has begun. If Arc Search or it's future successor scrapes ESPN to tell me the score of the Super Bowl, how can ESPN be fairly compensated? No longer are our eyeballs on espn.com important, instead we are interfacing using an AI Agent. So, what happens then?

### Where we're headed

There needs to be some sort of infrastructure that can provide these AI agents with the information they need, directly from the source. That is exactly where we come in at Tollbit. In our world, we believe that content providers and developers must have a symbiotic relationship in order for an AI agent driven future to thrive. Without this relationship in place, the value of creative, human content will continue to disappear. That is simply not a world where anyone wants to build towards.

As a developer, think about the potential for unbelievable new applications that could be built on top of structured, first-party data that would have never been possible before. As a content creator, we truly believe this is a serious opportunity to monetize and to continue capturing the value of your work.

The AI agent run Internet needs a new way to fairly compensate access to data. We hope that Tollbit becomes the standard for these transactions and powers this next generation of amazing applications on the Web.
